    - I'm very quiet and tend to stutter and blank when nervous
    - tend to overcomplicate explanations(overthinker)
    - rely too much on google, youtube, and chatgpt
    - Inconsistent(short spurts/One day I will be focused and other days I zone out)
    - Narrowminded(I forget to see the bigger picture)
- #### Hard Skills
    - I can accomplish tasks when given(reliable)
    - research well
    - able to communicate with others on things I need help with
    - personable(get along with the people around me)

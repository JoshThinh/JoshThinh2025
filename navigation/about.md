My name is Joshua Thinh, and I am very excited to take this class and delve deeper into computer science.

I enjoy playing sports and video games in my free time. I used to play basketball but now play volleyball on our school varsity team. The switch in sports was mainly due to the coaching and community differences. Volleyball is more laid-back and fits my vibe. My favorite subjects in school are math and technology because they just click in my brain. Other subjects like science and history aren’t my strongest, but I’ve had fun learning in them. However, English is my least favorite subject because it feels dull to me. My favorite food is ramen, which I first tried during my father's birthday celebration in elementary school. Coincidentally, the next day I was introduced to my least favorite food: sour cream, which I disliked because of its texture and taste.

I am good at working within a team and leading it to success. I am also very hard-working and determined, allowing me to complete any assignment given to me. However, I do struggle with decision-making because I tend to overthink, considering various outcomes before making a choice.

In the future, I hope to make my parents proud by becoming successful in the field of computer science. I plan to attend SDSU, following in my parents' footsteps. Computer science appeals to me not just because of its high earning potential but also because it is intellectually stimulating, especially with the variety of programming languages. Another goal is to maintain a healthy body and get stronger so I can continue to excel in volleyball.

Making my parents proud is a key motivator for me, highlighting how much my family means to me. I love my parents and siblings deeply, and they play a significant role in pushing me toward my goals. My faith is also important to me. Although I was introduced to Christianity by my parents, it wasn’t until a Christian retreat during my sophomore year that I started to take it more seriously.

I am looking forward to this computer science class to better understand the field's theoretical, practical, and innovative aspects.
